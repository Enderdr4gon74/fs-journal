## Questions

1. What is the purpose of wire-framing? 

- To pre-design the site or app easier and more efficiently to then use that as a basis for the real website or app.

2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?

- Low fidelity: low quality that act as basic visual representations and are best for being quick and easy to create.

- Mid fidelity: more accurate representations that essentially design the whole page except for stuff like images and text.

- High fidelity: highest quality representations including specific pixel lengths, text, images, etc. They may take long to make but they are an exact copy of what the site or app should look like.

3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?

- Yes, depending on the level of detail, they can be very useful in conveying to the developer what the site or app should look like and how to design it a lot better than a word explanation, etc.
