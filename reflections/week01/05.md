# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
1) What went well this week?

- I was able to mostly understand and figure out how to perform each coding action, and even if I didn't, I got help from either the TAs or the Instructors and eventually worked through all of the problems.

2) What did you learn as a shock or surprise?

- The main shock or surprise factor for me this week was probably the amount of work that some of the sites took to build out and finish.

3) What are you struggling with?

- I am not really struggling too much with anything, but the thing I have troubles with sometimes is certain syntax problems, although I haven't been stumped to the point where I can't completely continue.

4) What would you count as a victory?

- I would probably count when the site works exactly as specified and has no errors or slight problems.
