## Questions

1. What is Scope ?

- Scope is where the variables are available and are decided by the declaration type.

2. What is Hoisting ?

- Hoisting is a JS function that variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before code execution.

3. In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?

- Var: when you want a global variable then use var outside of any function, when you want a local / function-bound variable then use var inside a function.

- Let: Pretty much the same thing as var but it does have a big difference that fixes a lot of problems that var might cause. The problem it fixes it the fact that after it has been defined it can be altered but can't be redefined.

- Const: Const is pretty similar to let but it can't be altered or redefined after it has been defined.
