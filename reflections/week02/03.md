## Questions

1. What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.

- "console.log()": simply prints an item you give it to the console

- "console.error('error.message')": prints with a pink background and red text, for when errors happen

2. Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?

- The Elements tab, it shows all of the html elements and what they contain. This also includes each element's css styles. It can help in debugging when you have an element misbehaving, you can go to the elements tab and see what is causing the element to misbehave. 

3. Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?

- Break points: they pause the JS code when the break point occurs and help in seeing when stuff happens.
