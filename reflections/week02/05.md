# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
1) What went well this week?

- Since I had previous experience in Python and Java, I think learning JavaScript was very easy since it is a lot like the two previous languages I learned.

2) What did you learn as a shock or surprise?

- How hard it is add an item to an array that is stored in local storage already. you hav to delete the item inside local storage, then update all of the items in JS and the manually run your save function, and then it will update to have the additional item correctly.

3) What are you struggling with?

- Not really anything in particular, just some syntax sometimes.

4) What would you count as a victory?

- Being able to complete all of the projects and the checkpoint successfully while only having to ask for help once, and even then it was a simple syntax error that I had not caught.
