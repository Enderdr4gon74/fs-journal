> **ðŸ“– [The Observer Pattern](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk3/04-Observer-Pattern)**

## Questions

1. What problems does the Observer Pattern seek to solve?

- when you have multiple pushes and pulls, it can dynamically and quickly change the page by using pre designed elements and using the data modified to occupy the "proxy" element

2. What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern?

- Subscribe: Adds new observable events

- Unsubscribe: Removes observable events

- Broadcast: executes all events with bound data

3. Review the code generated from the bcw-template and reflect on the proxy objects from yesterday, and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the dom.

- It uses proxy objects to have the template for the event and it uses the observer pattern to add, remove, or manipulate all of the events in the way it wants to.
