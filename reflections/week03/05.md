# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
1) What went well this week?

- I think the best thing that went well this week was that, with the struggle of time, I was eventually able to work through all of my problems and make all of the project functional.

2) What did you learn as a shock or surprise?

- The thing that shocked me was how easy it was to mess up the mvc cycle and have it fall into chaos.

3)  What are you struggling with?

- Nothing too much, just syntax error every now and then.

4) What would you count as a victory?

- Being able to make all of my projects work in the end and work the way I wanted them to work.
