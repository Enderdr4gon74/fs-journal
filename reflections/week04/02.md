## Questions

1. What are the three states of a `Promise`?

- Pending: Initial state, before the Promise succeeds or fails

- Resolved: Completed Promise

- Rejected: Failed Promise

2. How do `promise`s seek to resolve the issues of "callback hell"?

- By letting attach callbacks to promises instead of passing them, they become a lot more organized, preventing "callback hell"

3. What is the difference between `.then()` and `.catch()`?

- .then(): is for resolved, finished, promises

- .catch(): is for rejected, failed, promises
