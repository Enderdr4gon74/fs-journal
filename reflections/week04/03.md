## Questions

1. What is the purpose of `Async`/`Await`?

- When a function may take a while, like when we pull, edit, delete, or add to a database, so we use async and await to allow the code to handle the time taken.

2. What must you do in order to  `await` a promise inside of a function?

- Make sure that the function that the await is in is async.

3. What are some of the primary benefits of `Async`/`Await`?

- It allows us to have the code run and wait for the promise and not just continue assuming the data has been pulled instantly.
