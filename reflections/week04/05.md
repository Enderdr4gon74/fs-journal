# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
1) What went well this week?
- overall the whole experience of using apis was a lot better than I thought it would be.
2) What did you learn as a shock or surprise?
- How picky the apis can be and how some you have to sign up for and have a User Id.
3) What are you struggling with?
- Nothing too much, but sometimes the syntax on apis can be a little difficult.
4) What would you count as a victory?
- Being able to fully build out all of my projects successfully.
