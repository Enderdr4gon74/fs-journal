## Questions

1. In simple terms what is timeboxing?

- Timeboxing is when you plan ahead on when you will take breaks and when you will work on stuff and how long you will spend on a problem before asking for help.

2. What three strategies will you implement and how?

- I will plan my time on when I take breaks

- I will plan how long a task should take to complete and try not to take longer that I anticipate.

- I will make sure when a problem lasts for more than I expected it to, I will make sure to ask for help and not let it take too long.

3. Give an example of when you would have benefitted from timeboxing and how? 

- When my team and I worked on our Hackathon, we benefited because of our breaks when we were a little too deep into the code and it allowed us to refresh our minds and understand it more.
