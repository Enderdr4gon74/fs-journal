# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
1) What went well this week?

- I think that the understanding of the main get post put and delete functions went pretty well

2) What did you learn as a shock or suprise?

- how complex Schemas are, especially the virtuals.

3) What are you struggling with?

- I think my understanding of the relationships isn't the best.

4) What would you count as a victory?

- My team and I got the hackathon project 90% finished and did pretty well.
