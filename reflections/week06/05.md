# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
  -  My understanding of vue grew at a normal pace and I was able to finish all of the projects.
- What did you learn as a shock or surprise?
  - how finicky vue can be with some stuff that you might do.
- What are you struggling with?
  - nothing too much, but my understanding of vue could improve.
- What would you count as a victory?
  - being able to complete all of my projects fully.
