## Questions

1. In a SQL table, what is the difference between information in a row and information in a column?

- row info is a whole item in the array

- column info is a type of data in the array

2. Demonstrate the basic structure for creating a new table called `characters` with the values `name, age, description` as strings, and an `int` id.

- CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS characters(
  name string NOT NULL,
  age string NOT NULL,
  description string NOT NULL,
  id INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
) default charset utf8 COMMENT '';

3. What are the difference between the following statements: 
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name;
DROP TABLE table_name;
```

- delete from deletes data in the table

- drop table deletes the whole table
