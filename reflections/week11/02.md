## Questions

1. What is the difference between a `primary key` and a `foreign key`

- primary keys are the id's of the item they are defined on.

- foreign keys are the id's of other items that belong to the other items and are a reference to them but are also defined on the main item, it allows you to populate data from other tables to a separate item

2. What is an `Alias`?

- an alias is a name used in sql to reference data in joins, wheres and other statements to allow for data addition or manipulation

3. Demonstrate how you would query a join statement that would get all of a doctors patients from the following collections:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE patients (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE appointments (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  doctorId INT NOT NULL,
  patientId INT NOT NULL,

  FOREIGN KEY (doctorId)
    REFERENCES doctors(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (patientId)
    REFERENCES patients(id),
)

** My code - 

SELECT 
  ap.*
  d.*
  p.* 
  FROM appointments
  JOIN doctors d ON d.id = ap.doctorId
  JOIN patients p ON p.id = ap.patientId;
