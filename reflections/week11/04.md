## Questions

Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your `final project`, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.

- my biggest concern is running into a problem I cant fix and not being able to get help and just getting stuck on it.
